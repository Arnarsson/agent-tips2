        "Memory requirements of LLMs can be best understood by seeing the LLM as a set of weight matrices and vectors and the text inputs as a sequence of vectors. In the following, the definition weights will be used to signify all model weight matrices and vectors.",
        "At the time of writing this guide, LLMs consist of at least a couple billion parameters. Each parameter thereby is made of a decimal number, e.g. 4.5689 which is usually stored in either float32, bfloat16, or float16 format. This allows us to easily compute the memory requirement to load the LLM into memory:",
        "Loading the weights of a model having X billion parameters requires roughly 4 X GB of VRAM in float32 precision*",
        "Nowadays, models are however rarely trained in full float32 precision, but usually in bfloat16 precision or less frequently in float16 precision. Therefore the rule of thumb becomes:",
        "For shorter text inputs (less than 1024 tokens), the memory requirement for inference is very much dominated by the memory requirement to load the weights. Therefore, for now, let’s assume that the memory requirement for inference is equal to the memory requirement to load the model into the GPU VRAM.",
        "To give some examples of how much VRAM it roughly takes to load a model in bfloat16:",
        "As of writing this document, the largest GPU chip on the market is the A100 & H100 offering 80GB of VRAM. Most of the models listed before require more than 80GB just to be loaded and therefore necessarily require tensor parallelism and/or pipeline parallelism.",
        "🤗 Transformers now supports tensor parallelism for supported models having base_tp_plan in their respecitve config classes. Learn more about Tensor Parallelism here. Furthermore, if you’re interested in writing models in a tensor-parallelism-friendly way, feel free to have a look at the text-generation-inference library.",
        "Naive pipeline parallelism is supported out of the box. For this, simply load the model with device=\"auto\" which will automatically place the different layers on the available GPUs as explained here.\nNote, however that while very effective, this naive pipeline parallelism does not tackle the issues of GPU idling. For this more advanced pipeline parallelism is required as explained here.",
        "If you have access to an 8 x 80GB A100 node, you could load BLOOM as follows",
        "By using device_map=\"auto\" the attention layers would be equally distributed over all available GPUs.",
        "In this guide, we will use bigcode/octocoder as it can be run on a single 40 GB A100 GPU device chip. Note that all memory and speed optimizations that we will apply going forward, are equally applicable to models that require model or tensor parallelism.",
        "Since the model is loaded in bfloat16 precision, using our rule of thumb above, we would expect the memory requirement to run inference with bigcode/octocoder to be around 31 GB VRAM. Let’s give it a try.",
        "We first load the model and tokenizer and then pass both to Transformers’ pipeline object.",
        "Output:",
        "Nice, we can now directly use the result to convert bytes into Gigabytes.",
        "Let’s call torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated to measure the peak GPU memory allocation.",
        "Close enough to our back-of-the-envelope computation! We can see the number is not exactly correct as going from bytes to kilobytes requires a multiplication of 1024 instead of 1000. Therefore the back-of-the-envelope formula can also be understood as an “at most X GB” computation.\nNote that if we had tried to run the model in full float32 precision, a whopping 64 GB of VRAM would have been required.",
        "Almost all models are trained in bfloat16 nowadays, there is no reason to run the model in full float32 precision if your GPU supports bfloat16. Float32 won’t give better inference results than the precision that was used to train the model.",
        "If you are unsure in which format the model weights are stored on the Hub, you can always look into the checkpoint’s config under \"torch_dtype\", e.g. here. It is recommended to set the model to the same precision type as written in the config when loading with from_pretrained(..., torch_dtype=...) except when the original type is float32 in which case one can use both float16 or bfloat16 for inference.",
        "Let’s define a flush(...) function to free all allocated memory so that we can accurately measure the peak allocated GPU memory.",
        "Let’s call it now for the next experiment.",
        "From the Accelerate library, you can also use a device-agnostic utility method called release_memory, which takes various hardware backends like XPU, MLU, NPU, MPS, and more into account.",
        "Now what if your GPU does not have 32 GB of VRAM? It has been found that model weights can be quantized to 8-bit or 4-bits without a significant loss in performance (see Dettmers et al.).\nModel can be quantized to even 3 or 2 bits with an acceptable loss in performance as shown in the recent GPTQ paper 🤯.",
        "Without going into too many details, quantization schemes aim at reducing the precision of weights while trying to keep the model’s inference results as accurate as possible (a.k.a as close as possible to bfloat16).\nNote that quantization works especially well for text generation since all we care about is choosing the set of most likely next tokens and don’t really care about the exact values of the next token logit distribution.\nAll that matters is that the next token logit distribution stays roughly the same so that an argmax or topk operation gives the same results.",
        "There are various quantization techniques, which we won’t discuss in detail here, but in general, all quantization techniques work as follows:",
        "are changed to\nY=X∗dequantize(W) Y = X * \\text{dequantize}(W) Y=X∗dequantize(W)",
        "for every matrix multiplication. Dequantization and re-quantization is performed sequentially for all weight matrices as the inputs run through the network graph.",
        "Therefore, inference time is often not reduced when using quantized weights, but rather increases.\nEnough theory, let’s give it a try! To quantize the weights with Transformers, you need to make sure that\nthe bitsandbytes library is installed.",
        "We can then load models in 8-bit quantization by simply adding a load_in_8bit=True flag to from_pretrained.",
        "Now, let’s run our example again and measure the memory usage.",
        "Nice, we’re getting the same result as before, so no loss in accuracy! Let’s look at how much memory was used this time.",
        "Significantly less! We’re down to just a bit over 15 GBs and could therefore run this model on consumer GPUs like the 4090.\nWe’re seeing a very nice gain in memory efficiency and more or less no degradation to the model’s output. However, we can also notice a slight slow-down during inference.",
        "We delete the models and flush the memory again.",
        "Let’s see what peak GPU memory consumption 4-bit quantization gives. Quantizing the model to 4-bit can be done with the same API as before - this time by passing load_in_4bit=True instead of load_in_8bit=True.",
        "We’re almost seeing the same output text as before - just the python is missing just before the code snippet. Let’s see how much memory was required.",
        "Just 9.5GB! That’s really not a lot for a >15 billion parameter model.",
        "While we see very little degradation in accuracy for our model here, 4-bit quantization can in practice often lead to different results compared to 8-bit quantization or full bfloat16 inference. It is up to the user to try it out.",
        "Also note that inference here was again a bit slower compared to 8-bit quantization which is due to the more aggressive quantization method used for 4-bit quantization leading toquantize \\text{quantize} quantize anddequantize \\text{dequantize} dequantize taking longer during inference.",
        "Overall, we saw that running OctoCoder in 8-bit precision reduced the required GPU VRAM from 32G GPU VRAM to only 15GB and running the model in 4-bit precision further reduces the required GPU VRAM to just a bit over 9GB.",
        "4-bit quantization allows the model to be run on GPUs such as RTX3090, V100, and T4 which are quite accessible for most people.",
        "For more information on quantization and to see how one can quantize models to require even less GPU VRAM memory than 4-bit, we recommend looking into the AutoGPTQ implementation.",
        "As a conclusion, it is important to remember that model quantization trades improved memory efficiency against accuracy and in some cases inference time.",
        "If GPU memory is not a constraint for your use case, there is often no need to look into quantization. However many GPUs simply can’t run LLMs without quantization methods and in this case, 4-bit and 8-bit quantization schemes are extremely useful tools.",
        "For more in-detail usage information, we strongly recommend taking a look at the Transformers Quantization Docs.\nNext, let’s look into how we can improve computational and memory efficiency by using better algorithms and an improved model architecture."

        "Today’s top-performing LLMs share more or less the same fundamental architecture that consists of feed-forward layers, activation layers, layer normalization layers, and most crucially, self-attention layers.",
        "Self-attention layers are central to Large Language Models (LLMs) in that they enable the model to understand the contextual relationships between input tokens.\nHowever, the peak GPU memory consumption for self-attention layers grows quadratically both in compute and memory complexity with number of input tokens (also called sequence length) that we denote in the following byN N N .\nWhile this is not really noticeable for shorter input sequences (of up to 1000 input tokens), it becomes a serious problem for longer input sequences (at around 16000 input tokens).",
        "Let’s take a closer look. The formula to compute the outputO \\mathbf{O} O of a self-attention layer for an inputX \\mathbf{X} X of lengthN N N is:\nO=Attn(X)=V×Softmax(QKT) with Q=WqX,V=WvX,K=WkX \\textbf{O} = \\text{Attn}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathbf{V} \\times \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^T) \\text{ with } \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{W}_q \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{W}_v \\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{W}_k \\mathbf{X} O=Attn(X)=V×Softmax(QKT) with Q=Wq​X,V=Wv​X,K=Wk​X X=(x1,...xN)  \\mathbf{X} = (\\mathbf{x}_1, ... \\mathbf{x}_{N}) X=(x1​,...xN​) is thereby the input sequence to the attention layer. The projectionsQ \\mathbf{Q} Q andK \\mathbf{K} K will each consist ofN N N vectors resulting in theQKT \\mathbf{QK}^T QKT being of sizeN2 N^2 N2 .",
        "LLMs usually have multiple attention heads, thus doing multiple self-attention computations in parallel.\nAssuming, the LLM has 40 attention heads and runs in bfloat16 precision, we can calculate the memory requirement to store theQKT \\mathbf{QK^T} QKT matrices to be40∗2∗N2 40 * 2 * N^2 40∗2∗N2 bytes. ForN=1000 N=1000 N=1000 only around 50 MB of VRAM are needed, however, forN=16000 N=16000 N=16000 we would need 19 GB of VRAM, and forN=100,000 N=100,000 N=100,000 we would need almost 1TB just to store theQKT \\mathbf{QK}^T QKT matrices.",
        "Long story short, the default self-attention algorithm quickly becomes prohibitively memory-expensive for large input contexts.",
        "As LLMs improve in text comprehension and generation, they are applied to increasingly complex tasks. While models once handled the translation or summarization of a few sentences, they now manage entire pages, demanding the capability to process extensive input lengths.",
        "How can we get rid of the exorbitant memory requirements for large input lengths? We need a new way to compute the self-attention mechanism that gets rid of theQKT QK^T QKT matrix. Tri Dao et al. developed exactly such a new algorithm and called it Flash Attention.",
        "In a nutshell, Flash Attention breaks the V×Softmax(QKT\\mathbf{V} \\times \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^TV×Softmax(QKT) computation apart and instead computes smaller chunks of the output by iterating over multiple softmax computation steps:\nOi←sija∗Oi+sijb∗Vj×Softmax(QKi,jT) for multiple i,j iterations \\textbf{O}_i \\leftarrow s^a_{ij} * \\textbf{O}_i + s^b_{ij} * \\mathbf{V}_{j} \\times \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^T_{i,j}) \\text{ for multiple } i, j \\text{ iterations} Oi​←sija​∗Oi​+sijb​∗Vj​×Softmax(QKi,jT​) for multiple i,j iterations",
        "withsija s^a_{ij} sija​ andsijb s^b_{ij} sijb​ being some softmax normalization statistics that need to be recomputed for everyi i i andj j j .",
        "Please note that the whole Flash Attention is a bit more complex and is greatly simplified here as going in too much depth is out of scope for this guide. The reader is invited to take a look at the well-written Flash Attention paper for more details.",
        "The main takeaway here is:",
        "By keeping track of softmax normalization statistics and by using some smart mathematics, Flash Attention gives numerical identical outputs compared to the default self-attention layer at a memory cost that only increases linearly withN N N .",
        "Looking at the formula, one would intuitively say that Flash Attention must be much slower compared to the default self-attention formula as more computation needs to be done. Indeed Flash Attention requires more FLOPs compared to normal attention as the softmax normalization statistics have to constantly be recomputed (see paper for more details if interested)",
        "However, Flash Attention is much faster in inference compared to default attention which comes from its ability to significantly reduce the demands on the slower, high-bandwidth memory of the GPU (VRAM), focusing instead on the faster on-chip memory (SRAM).",
        "Essentially, Flash Attention makes sure that all intermediate write and read operations can be done using the fast on-chip SRAM memory instead of having to access the slower VRAM memory to compute the output vectorO \\mathbf{O} O .",
        "In practice, there is currently absolutely no reason to not use Flash Attention if available. The algorithm gives mathematically the same outputs, and is both faster and more memory-efficient.",
        "Let’s look at a practical example.",
        "Our OctoCoder model now gets a significantly longer input prompt which includes a so-called system prompt. System prompts are used to steer the LLM into a better assistant that is tailored to the users’ task.\nIn the following, we use a system prompt that will make OctoCoder a better coding assistant.",
        "For demonstration purposes, we duplicate the system prompt by ten so that the input length is long enough to observe Flash Attention’s memory savings.\nWe append the original text prompt \"Question: Please write a function in Python that transforms bytes to Giga bytes.\\n\\nAnswer: Here\"",
        "We instantiate our model again in bfloat16 precision.",
        "Let’s now run the model just like before without Flash Attention and measure the peak GPU memory requirement and inference time.",
        "We’re getting the same output as before, however this time, the model repeats the answer multiple times until it’s 60 tokens cut-off. This is not surprising as we’ve repeated the system prompt ten times for demonstration purposes and thus cued the model to repeat itself.",
        "Note that the system prompt should not be repeated ten times in real-world applications - one time is enough!",
        "As we can see the peak GPU memory requirement is now significantly higher than in the beginning, which is largely due to the longer input sequence. Also the generation takes a little over a minute now.",
        "For comparison, let’s run the same function, but enable Flash Attention instead.\nTo do so, we convert the model to BetterTransformer and by doing so enabling PyTorch’s SDPA self-attention which in turn is able to use Flash Attention.",
        "Now we run the exact same code snippet as before and under the hood Transformers will make use of Flash Attention.",
        "We’re getting the exact same result as before, but can observe a very significant speed-up thanks to Flash Attention.",
        "Let’s measure the memory consumption one last time.",
        "And we’re almost back to our original 29GB peak GPU memory from the beginning.",
        "We can observe that we only use roughly 100MB more GPU memory when passing a very long input sequence with Flash Attention compared to passing a short input sequence as done in the beginning.",
        "For more information on how to use Flash Attention, please have a look at this doc page."

        "Self-attention puts each token in relation to each other’s tokens.\nAs an example, theSoftmax(QKT) \\text{Softmax}(\\mathbf{QK}^T) Softmax(QKT) matrix of the text input sequence “Hello”, “I”, “love”, “you” could look as follows:",
        "Each word token is given a probability mass at which it attends all other word tokens and, therefore is put into relation with all other word tokens. E.g. the word “love” attends to the word “Hello” with 5%, to “I” with 30%, and to itself with 65%.",
        "A LLM based on self-attention, but without position embeddings would have great difficulties in understanding the positions of the text inputs to each other.\nThis is because the probability score computed byQKT \\mathbf{QK}^T QKT relates each word token to each other word token inO(1) O(1) O(1) computations regardless of their relative positional distance to each other.\nTherefore, for the LLM without position embeddings each token appears to have the same distance to all other tokens, e.g. differentiating between “Hello I love you” and “You love I hello” would be very challenging.",
        "For the LLM to understand sentence order, an additional cue is needed and is usually applied in the form of positional encodings (or also called positional embeddings).\nPositional encodings, encode the position of each token into a numerical presentation that the LLM can leverage to better understand sentence order.",
        "The authors of the Attention Is All You Need paper introduced sinusoidal positional embeddingsP=p1,…,pN \\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{p}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{p}_N P=p1​,…,pN​ .\nwhere each vectorpi \\mathbf{p}_i pi​ is computed as a sinusoidal function of its positioni i i .\nThe positional encodings are then simply added to the input sequence vectorsX^=x^1,…,x^N \\mathbf{\\hat{X}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_N X^=x^1​,…,x^N​ =x1+p1,…,xN+pN \\mathbf{x}_1 + \\mathbf{p}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_N + \\mathbf{p}_N x1​+p1​,…,xN​+pN​ thereby cueing the model to better learn sentence order.",
        "Instead of using fixed position embeddings, others (such as Devlin et al.) used learned positional encodings for which the positional embeddingsP \\mathbf{P} P are learned during training.",
        "Sinusoidal and learned position embeddings used to be the predominant methods to encode sentence order into LLMs, but a couple of problems related to these positional encodings were found:",
        "Recently, relative positional embeddings that can tackle the above mentioned problems have become more popular, most notably:",
        "Both RoPE and ALiBi argue that it’s best to cue the LLM about sentence order directly in the self-attention algorithm as it’s there that word tokens are put into relation with each other. More specifically, sentence order should be cued by modifying theQKT \\mathbf{QK}^T QKT computation.",
        "Without going into too many details, RoPE notes that positional information can be encoded into query-key pairs, e.g.qi \\mathbf{q}_i qi​ andxj \\mathbf{x}_j xj​ by rotating each vector by an angleθ∗i \\theta * i θ∗i andθ∗j \\theta * j θ∗j respectively withi,j i, j i,j describing each vectors sentence position:\nq^iTx^j=qiTRθ,i−jxj. \\mathbf{\\hat{q}}_i^T \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_j = \\mathbf{{q}}_i^T \\mathbf{R}_{\\theta, i -j} \\mathbf{{x}}_j. q^​iT​x^j​=qiT​Rθ,i−j​xj​. Rθ,i−j \\mathbf{R}_{\\theta, i - j} Rθ,i−j​ thereby represents a rotational matrix.θ \\theta θ is not learned during training, but instead set to a pre-defined value that depends on the maximum input sequence length during training.",
        "By doing so, the propability score betweenqi \\mathbf{q}_i qi​ andqj \\mathbf{q}_j qj​ is only affected ifi≠j i \\ne j i=j and solely depends on the relative distancei−j i - j i−j regardless of each vector’s specific positionsi i i andj j j .",
        "RoPE is used in multiple of today’s most important LLMs, such as:",
        "As an alternative, ALiBi proposes a much simpler relative position encoding scheme. The relative distance that input tokens have to each other is added as a negative integer scaled by a pre-defined value m to each query-key entry of theQKT \\mathbf{QK}^T QKT matrix right before the softmax computation.",
        "As shown in the ALiBi paper, this simple relative positional encoding allows the model to retain a high performance even at very long text input sequences.",
        "Both RoPE and ALiBi position encodings can extrapolate to input lengths not seen during training whereas it has been shown that extrapolation works much better out-of-the-box for ALiBi as compared to RoPE.\nFor ALiBi, one simply increases the values of the lower triangular position matrix to match the length of the input sequence.\nFor RoPE, keeping the sameθ \\theta θ that was used during training leads to poor results when passing text inputs much longer than those seen during training, c.f Press et al.. However, the community has found a couple of effective tricks that adaptθ \\theta θ, thereby allowing RoPE position embeddings to work well for extrapolated text input sequences (see here).",
        "Both RoPE and ALiBi are relative positional embeddings that are not learned during training, but instead are based on the following intuitions:",
        "In conclusion, LLMs that are intended to be deployed in tasks that require handling large text inputs are better trained with relative positional embeddings, such as RoPE and ALiBi. Also note that even if an LLM with RoPE and ALiBi has been trained only on a fixed length of sayN1=2048 N_1 = 2048 N1​=2048 it can still be used in practice with text inputs much larger thanN1 N_1 N1​, likeN2=8192>N1 N_2 = 8192 > N_1 N2​=8192>N1​ by extrapolating the positional embeddings."

        "Multi-Query-Attention was proposed in Noam Shazeer’s Fast Transformer Decoding: One Write-Head is All You Need paper. As the title says, Noam found out that instead of using n_head key-value projections weights, one can use a single head-value projection weight pair that is shared across all attention heads without that the model’s performance significantly degrades.",
        "By using a single head-value projection weight pair, the key value vectorski,vi \\mathbf{k}_i, \\mathbf{v}_i ki​,vi​ have to be identical across all attention heads which in turn means that we only need to store 1 key-value projection pair in the cache instead of n_head ones.",
        "As most LLMs use between 20 and 100 attention heads, MQA significantly reduces the memory consumption of the key-value cache. For the LLM used in this notebook we could therefore reduce the required memory consumption from 15 GB to less than 400 MB at an input sequence length of 16000.",
        "The important part to understand here is that reducing the number of key-value attention heads to 1 only makes sense if a key-value cache is used. The peak memory consumption of the model for a single forward pass without key-value cache stays unchanged as every attention head still has a unique query vector so that each attention head still has a differentQKT \\mathbf{QK}^T QKT matrix.",
        "MQA has seen wide adoption by the community and is now used by many of the most popular LLMs:",
        "Also, the checkpoint used in this notebook - bigcode/octocoder - makes use of MQA.",
        "Grouped-Query-Attention, as proposed by Ainslie et al. from Google, found that using MQA can often lead to quality degradation compared to using vanilla multi-key-value head projections. The paper argues that more model performance can be kept by less drastically reducing the number of query head projection weights. Instead of using just a single key-value projection weight, n < n_head key-value projection weights should be used. By choosing n to a significantly smaller value than n_head, such as 2,4 or 8 almost all of the memory and speed gains from MQA can be kept while sacrificing less model capacity and thus arguably less performance.",
        "Moreover, the authors of GQA found out that existing model checkpoints can be uptrained to have a GQA architecture with as little as 5% of the original pre-training compute. While 5% of the original pre-training compute can still be a massive amount, GQA uptraining allows existing checkpoints to be useful for longer input sequences.",
        "GQA was only recently proposed which is why there is less adoption at the time of writing this notebook.\nThe most notable application of GQA is Llama-v2.",
        "As a conclusion, it is strongly recommended to make use of either GQA or MQA if the LLM is deployed with auto-regressive decoding and is required to handle large input sequences as is the case for example for chat."

        "The research community is constantly coming up with new, nifty ways to speed up inference time for ever-larger LLMs. As an example, one such promising research direction is speculative decoding where “easy tokens” are generated by smaller, faster language models and only “hard tokens” are generated by the LLM itself. Going into more detail is out of the scope of this notebook, but can be read upon in this nice blog post.",
        "The reason massive LLMs such as GPT3/4, Llama-2-70b, Claude, PaLM can run so quickly in chat-interfaces such as Hugging Face Chat or ChatGPT is to a big part thanks to the above-mentioned improvements in precision, algorithms, and architecture.\nGoing forward, accelerators such as GPUs, TPUs, etc… will only get faster and allow for more memory, but one should nevertheless always make sure to use the best available algorithms and architectures to get the most bang for your buck 🤗"
